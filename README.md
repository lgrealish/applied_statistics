# Applied Statistics 2024

## Summary
This repository contains my submission for the Applied Statistics Module 2024 at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics.  There are 2 elements to this submission each of which are contained in a Jupyter notebook.

### Tasks
There were 4 tasks set, the details of which can be viewed in this repository [instructions](/instructions.ipynb).

The notebook containing all the work for these tasks is called [tasks.ipynb](/tasks.ipynb).  

### Project
The project concerns analysis of the PlantGrowth R dataset, details of the project [instructions](/instructions.ipynb) can be found in this repository.

The notebook containing all of the work for this project is called [project.ipynb](/project.ipynb).   

## How to download this repository

This repository and all files within it can be access at https://github.com/lgrealish/applied_statistics.


## How to run the code

Python 3 was used to develop this project and is needed to run the code in the notebook.

If the repository is downloaded it can be run locally by navigating to the folder and entering the command Jupyter lab or Jupyter notebook on the command line. This will open Jupyter in the browser. The notebook can be opened then within the Jupyter session. Once opened you can can select Restart Kernel and Run All from the Run or Kernel menu. You can also run the selected cells and advance through the notebook using the run icon. The code should be run from top to bottom. The main python libraries used pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy are loaded at the beginning of the notebook. These are part of the anaconda distribution of python. Any additional libraries used are loaded within the relevant section of the notebook but are not central to the project.

Alternatively it can be viewed using Visual Studio Code, once downloaded locally.
